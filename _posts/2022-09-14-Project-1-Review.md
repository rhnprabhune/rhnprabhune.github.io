# Project 1 Review

I recently completed [Project 1](https://rawcdn.githack.com/rhnprabhune/rhnprabhune.github.io/main/documents/rjprabhu_project1.html) as a part of my curriculum for **ST 558: Data Science for Statisticians**.

### Purpose of the project
The project's main objective was to familiarize participants with R programming language and R environment for data science. It involved creating functions to read in csv files, process and transform data sets and combine them to be plotted to derive insights. Additionally, it attempted to provide a custom function that would automatically plot the returned data.
The data sets used in the project contained information from the census bureau. 

### Learnings
Given that I am new to R, this was the ideal project for me to practice working with dataframes/tibbles, which appear to be crucial components of data science. I gained a lot of knowledge about R as a novice. I've attempted to list the key lessons I've taken away from this project:  
1. Dplyr package: Although my homework offered me some practice with this package, the use cases for this project were more complicated, giving me more practical experience in subsetting, manipulating, and arranging the rows and columns of a tibble.

### Corrections/ Future scope

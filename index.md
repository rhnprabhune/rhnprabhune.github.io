Hello,

I am a grad student at NC State University in Raleigh. I have created this blog as a part of my curriculum for the course **ST 558: Data Science for Statisticians**. 
Along with grad school I am also working part-time as a software developer for creating a hosted analytics environment. In this blog I intended to cover some of the interesting topics surrounding the field of Data Science, Data Analytics and Statistics.

If you feel like exchanging ideas please feel free to contact me via email/linkedIn (at the bottom of the page). If you have something interesting to share via this blog and are well versed with github, please raise an issue in [my github repo](https://github.com/rhnprabhune/rhnprabhune.github.io/issues)
